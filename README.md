CadQuery models, mostly practicing

 * leg_form is a corner of a concrete table form. It takes a nominal 4x4
   support, screws to a plywood bottom support and to nominal one-by side
   supports. I'm using it to make a heavy table for the 3D printer that will be
   printing it (beforehand, weird).
   
 * dolly_roller rides on a 1" aluminum tube across the two rails of
   the Nethercott dolly.
